# CityTrafficSimulator++
CityTrafficSimulator++ is a re-implementation of [CityTrafficSimulator](http://www.citytrafficsimulator.de/) using modern C++ 11. While the core mechanics will still implement a microscopic traffic simulation software for small- to medium-sized traffic networks, the main motivation of this version is to have a much better software architecture. This should make implementing custom extensions and integrating CTS into third-party software much easier. Furthermore, I have a couple of ideas for cool features that would not be implementable as easy in the original version.


## Licensing
CityTrafficSimulator++ is licensed under the GPL version 3. In the case that it will be as successful as its predecessor, I will consider a dual licensing scheme allowing for commercial usage without the need to adhere to the GPL.
